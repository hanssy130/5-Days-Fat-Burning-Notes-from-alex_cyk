# Winner's Standard
* Winners **PERFORM** knowing that hard work is needed to achieve RESULTS, losers create EXCUSES not to do them
* Winners find **WAYS** to succeed. Losers stay at a problem and do nothing about it.
* Winners are **SERIOUS** about getting results. Losers talk about winners' results.

# Fitness Commandments
* Mind > Matter
* Pain = Fats are CRYING
* If you feel like *quitting*, **REMEMBER WHY YOU STARTED**, and ask for **SUPPORT**

# Chapter 1: Weight
Weight is defined as:
* Water weight (Sodium)
* Muscle
* Body fat

... and our goal is to burn excess **FAT**

## Common Fat Loss Mistakes
* Eating too little/too much
* Training too little/too much
* Too much cardio
* Not enough muscles
* Cutting off carbs
* Not enough protein

## Fat Loss Solution
* Caloric Deficit
* Build lean muscle to burn fat
* Build a **LIFESTYLE** that supports the motive of fat loss & fitness

### Caloric Deficit
* Caloric Deficit: Consuming below your TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)

**Example**: Alex's TDEE is 2800 calories per day to maintain his body weight. If he eats at 2500, he's at a 300 **Caloric Deficit**.

* Warning: an extreme deficit will be *counter productive*.

### Build Muscle To Support Fat Loss
* It's easier to **burn muscle** than to burn fat
* The more muscle you have, the higher your TDEE
* The more muscle you have, the stronger & healthier you are
Disclaimer: Building muscle own't make you look too much, you need steroids to do that.

## Commitment
* 30-45 min of training 3-5x per week
* Access to foods with higher protein
* 7-8 hours of sleep minimum

### Lifestyle
You want to enjoy calories **without worrying** about gaining fat because you know **YOU CAN** burn them off!

You want to be:
* **Confident** with your body
* **Strong** physically
* **Fit & Sexy**
* always have **High Energy**

# Chapter 2: Caloric Deficit
For the next 5 days:
* Measure our bodyweight every morning on an empty stomach
* Train for 5 days straight (bodyweight & cardio)
* Maintain caloric deficit
* update progress

## What happens when you are on a caloric deficit?
* Body will tap into weight (muscles/fat) for energy. 
* When this happens, we want to preserve muscle, and use fat as main source of energy
* You will feel tired
* You will consume Caloric Deficit for 4 days, then do a **REFEED** day on day 5.

### a) Achieving Caloric Deficit for MEN
* In order to burn 1 lb of bodyweight ,you have to **burn 3500 calories** to achieve it.
* For a starting caloric deficit plan, we will set it at ***11 calories per pound*** of bodyweight, this would be a 25% deficit from our TDEE

Example:
* Alex weighs 190lbs
* 190 * 11 = 2090 calories
* Alex eats at 2090 calories for 4 days

### b) Achieving Caloric Deficit for WOMEN
* Women's macronutrients are different from men. To keep it simple, set it at **10 calories per pound** of bodyweight.

Example:
* Lisa weighs 132lbs
* 132 * 10 = 1320 calories
* Lisa eats at 1320 calories for 4 days

### c) Refeed day
* Because of 4 days of Caloric Deficit, your body is starving for energy. Too long and your body will risk burning muscles. Bad!
* Refeed day is to increase caloric intake to replenish calories for muscles. Do this on day 5.
* Calories must come from **Carbohydrates**
* Men = +600
* Women = +400

Example
* Alex eats at 2090 calories for 4 days, and then 2690 calories on the 5th day.
* Lisa eats at 1320 calories for 4 days, and then 1720 on the 5th day.

# Chapter 3: Calories
## 1) Macronutrients
In simple terms, our food is categorized into 3 groups:
* Proteins
* Fats
* Carbohydrates

### a) Benefit of Protein
* Used to **build and repair** muscles
* 20 amino acids in protein
* Only **9 essential amino acids** actually strengthen muscles

#### Type of Protein for Muscle Building
* Eggs
* Chicken
* Fish
* Beef

### b) Benefit of Fats
* Helps **regulate hormones** and provide **energy**
* makes food **tasty**
* types of fats:
  * saturated
  * **unsaturated** <-- best one
  * polyunsaturated
  * mono unsaturated
  * trans fats
  
#### Type of Fats for Muscle Building
* Avocado
* Olive Oil
* Salmon
* Eggs
* Peanut Butter

### c) Benefit of Carbohydrates
* Used for energy and fills up tummy
* Replenishes glycogen, which leads to feeling pumped during training
* Prevents protein being used as energy
* **Sugar are carbs**

**Carbs are BEST FRIENDS for FAT LOSS**

Just don't over eat it.

#### Typesof Carbs for Muscle Building
* Rice
* Oats
* Potatoes
* Pasta
* Banana

## Breaking Down Calories into Specific Food

### 1. Measure Protein
* 1g Protein = 4 calories
* Set Protein to 1g per pound of bodyweight

Example:
* Alex weighs 190lbs
* 190g * 4g/cal = 760 calories
* Alex needs 190g/760cal of **protein** per day

* Lisa weighs 130lbs
* 130 * 4g/cal = 520 calories
* Lisa needs 130g/520cal of **protein** per day

### 2. Measure Fat
* 1g Fat = 9 calories
* Set Fat to 0.4 per pound of bodyweight

Example:
* Alex weighs 190lbs
* 190lb * 0.4g/lb = 76g of fat
* 76g * 9g/cal = 684 calories
* Alex needs 76g/684cal of **fat** per day

* Lisa weighs 130lbs
* 130lb * 0.4g/lb = 52g of fat
* 76g * 9g/cal = 468 calories
* Lisa needs 52g/468cal of **fat** per day

### 3. Measure Carbs
* 1g Carbs = 4 calories
* Carbs will cover remainign calories

Example: 
* Alex needs 2090 Calories
* Alex consumes 760cal of protein & 684 cal of fat
* 2090 - (760 + 684) = 646
* 646cal / 4g/cal = 161.5g of carbs
* Alex needs 161.5g/646cal of **carbs** per day

* Lisa needs 1350 Calories
* Lisa consumes 520cal of protein & 468 cal of fat
* 1350 - (520 + 468) = 362
* 362cal / 4g/cal = 90.5g of carbs
* Lisa needs 90.5g/362cal of **carbs** per day

### Conclusion
Alex needs 2090 Calories per day
* 190g Protein
* 76 Fats
* 161.5g Carbs

Lisa needs 1350 Calories per day
* 130g Protein
* 52g Fats
* 90.5g Carbs

# Chapter 4: Intermittent Fasting
* Strategy to cycle eating window
* We will definitely be in a caloric deficit
* Redefine Breakfast, Lunch, and Dinner to Meal 1, Meal 2, and Meal 3

## Benefits
* Increase **Fat Burning** by taping into body fat storage
* **Lower** blood insulin & sugar levels
* Increase **Mental Focus**
* Creates a **Satisfying** meal

## Entering Intermittent Fasting
* Goal is to **FAST** the first 4-6 hours of the day
* During fasting, no food can be consumed

Example Strategy:
1. Wake up at 8am
2. Drink coffee/tea at 9am
3. Train at 10am
4. Meal 1 at 12pm/1pm/2pm (50% of calories)
  * 250g chicken breast, 300g rice, veggies, soup
5. Meal 2 at 4pm/5pm/6pm (30% of calories)
  * Fish, noodles, veggies
6. Meal 3 at 7pm/8pm/9pm (20% of calories)
  * Egg, veggies
  
Consume the AMOUNT of calories you need in a day.

## How To Succeed
* Drink plenty of **WATER**
* Drink coffee or tea (no sugar)
* **Train** before breaking fast

## Advice
* 1 Big Meal (40-50% of calories)
* 1 medium meal (25-35% of calories) about 3-5 hours later
* 1 snack/smaller meal (15-20% of remiaining calories)
* Make sure PROTEIN is covered!
* Include Protein in first 2 meals
* **Don't eat boring food!** Be creative with your meals. Season and make it delicious!
